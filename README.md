Self-Evaluation Document
Half-Page Summary: The project successfully implements a Kanban-style task management dashboard with drag-and-drop functionality and API integration. The UI is clean and responsive, but the drag-and-drop experience could be smoother.

Self-Criticism: The code could be more modular, and error handling for API calls is minimal.

Improvements: Add animations for drag-and-drop, improve error handling, and implement task editing.
